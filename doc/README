RochePlot plots Roche lobes for given evolutionary phases of a binary star


RochePlot is a Fortran code using PGPlot to plot a series of binaries to 
illustrate the key stages in the evolution of a binary star.  The code was 
originally written by Frank Verbunt and further developed by Marc van der 
Sluys.  The source code for rochePlot can be found at http://rocheplot.sf.net

In order for the code to run, it will need an input file with the data
of the binary systems that must be plotted.  An example input file is
provided in rochePlot.dat, and should typically be installed in 
/usr/share/rochePlot/  Visit http://rocheplot.sf.net for more information.
