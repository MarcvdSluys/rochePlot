RochePlot plots Roche lobes for given evolutionary phases of a binary star


RochePlot is a Fortran code using PGPlot to plot a series of binaries to 
illustrate the key stages in the evolution of a binary star.  The code was 
originally written by Frank Verbunt and further developed by Marc van der 
Sluys.  The source code for RochePlot can be found at http://rocheplot.sourceforge.net
