rochePlot INSTALL


RochePlot has the following dependencies.  All can be downloaded for free.
CMake:    http://www.cmake.org
PGPlot:   http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/
libSUFR:  http://libsufr.sf.net

You can use CMake to configure and compile the code.  RochePlot needs PGPlot to do the
plotting.  libSUFR provides some general Fortran routines.


To compile and install the code (in the CMake default directory /usr/local/), 
from the main package directory (the one that contains the file CMakeLists.txt), do:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake ..
 $ make
 $ sudo make install


To install the code in a specific directory, e.g. the Linux default /usr/, 
   replace the "cmake .." step above with:

 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr ..

This will install binaries in /usr/bin/, libraries in /usr/lib/, etc.


If you're installing the code somewhere in your home directory, you can leave out
   the sudo command in the last step:

 $ make install


To force CMake to compile the code with your favourite compiler, prepend the cmake line 
   with e.g. FC=gfortran:

 $ FC=gfortran cmake ..


To compile the code without installing it anywhere, leave out the last step
   ((sudo) make install)


The code comes with an example input file, which should be installed as e.g.
/usr/share/rochePlot/rochePlot.dat
